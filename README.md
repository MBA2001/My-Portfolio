# My-Portofolio
These are some of the projects i created while teaching myself programming, i dove into different categories on the way hope you like it

I am a cs major student, who focused on self learning as it was the only way to reach the level i want
that is why im ahead of my college in terms of knowledge and work i made alot of projects in lots of categories
but the one that hit me the most is web developement front and back end, i created some projects with JS and i love it
im ready to take on more challenges and reach a higher level everyday as this is my passion.
